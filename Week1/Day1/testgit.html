    <h2>Why I Decided to Learn to Code</h2>
    <p>
        I decided to learn to code because I have always been fascinated by how technology works. 
        The idea of <strong>building something from scratch</strong> that can help people or solve real-world problems really excites me. 
        I believe that <em>coding opens doors</em> to endless opportunities, and I want to be a part of that future.
